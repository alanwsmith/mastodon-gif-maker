# Mastodon GIF Maker

I built this on the day posting links to other social 
networks would get you banned. Since that was revered
(we think) within 24 hours it's not as necessary, but
it's still fun. 

Plus, I have this amusing vision of Twitter being
taken over with GIFs saying "I've Moved To Mastodon"
